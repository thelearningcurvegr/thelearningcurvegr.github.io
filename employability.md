Our Skills Development pillar focuses on building the competencies people need to grow, adapt, and succeed in a rapidly changing world. While our Tech Lab creates tools, our Skills Hub creates experiences! Together, we help individuals learn how to use technology, while also strengthening the human skills that no machine can replace. 
We support professionals, educators, youth, and job seekers in developing practical skills that unlock their confidence, enhance employability, and lifelong learning.
