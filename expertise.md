Our team brings together professionals with strong backgrounds in artificial intelligence, applied research, software engineering, education, and project management. Our members are actively involved in EU-funded research projects, contributing to initiatives that push forward innovation in areas such as advanced AI systems, digital learning tools, and real-world technology deployment.

Our expertise spans large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), agentic workflows, visual AI, and end-to-end software development. With experience in designing and implementing complex AI systems, we bridge the gap between research and practical application, ensuring that technology is both functional and meaningful for its users.

Many of our team members have backgrounds in applied mathematics, programming, teaching, and entrepreneurship, bringing more than a decade of combined experience to the organisation. This diverse knowledge base allows us to approach challenges from multiple angles, blending analytical thinking with creativity and hands-on problem-solving.

Curious, committed, and driven by impact, our people carry their real-world expertise into the NGO — strengthening our ability to design programmes that are relevant, modern, and aligned with the evolving needs of society.
