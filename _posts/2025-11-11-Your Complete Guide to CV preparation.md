A Curriculum Vitae (CV) is a document that presents your professional identity, including your education, experience, skills, abilities, and achievements.  
 
### Why do you need a CV? 
Your CV is your first impression to emploers. It serves as a strategic presentation of your qualifications and value to prospective employers.  
 
### Key CV Components 
Your CV should include specific sections that employers expect to see. Start with your personal details: full name, valid mobile number, and general address location (avoid revealing your exact address for privacy).  
 
You can either include your work experience in reverse chronological order, listing your most recent position first with job titles, company names, locations, and employment dates, or you can include your work experience in clusters, based on similar roles and responsibilities.  
 
Document your education attainment, including degrees, certifications, academic qualifications. Add any professional training you have completed, along with foreign language skills that could benefit employers.  
 
Consider including additional activities such as volunteer work, professional memberships, publications, awards, or relevant hobbies and demonstrate transferable skills.

Integrity: Never include false information or lie on your CV. Honesty and integrity are fundamental to your professional reputation and can be easily verified.  
Avoid Unprofessional Elements: Be careful with the photos you use, unprofessional email addresses, or invalid phone numbers. These elements can disqualify you from consideration.  
Avoid using abbreviations, spelling and grammatical mistakes. Remove unnecessary personal information such as exact address, or irrelevant past roles that do not support your current career goals.
